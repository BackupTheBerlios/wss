 
White Source Software is currently developed with
openSUSE 12.2
KDE 4.8.5
gcc 4.7.1 

Limitation:
pre alpha, please make frequent backup
works preferably with SDL2 

Libraries:
-xorg developement files ( xorg-x11-devel or something alike )
-SDL2; available on sdllib.org website. Before compiling SDL2, you must have installed the xorg developement files
-freetype2 ( freetype2-devel )
-boost_regex ( boost-devel )

Installation:
set the environment variable LL_PATH to the path of wss
change in the directory wss;
make -f makewcp; compile lamb
make -f makesdl; compile sdl ( sdl is not the SDL2 library but wss for SDL2 )
lamb -s sdl; set a local environment file to run wss with SDL2 
lamb; launch sdl, sdl run also standalone for test purpose 

First step:
the editor is similar to vim
:e filename; to edit a file
:w; to save the file
:q ( or F2); to quite 

:kbl us ( or de, or fr ); to switch between us, german an french keyboard.   


CTRR s; switch between commandline and editor
CTRL o; rotate the option compiling, clean the code, compile an other project 
CTRR t; compile sdl and if sucessful relaunch it, clean sdl or compile an other project 

in the shell, lamb -save to backup the exefile sdl, lamb -r to restore the exefile sdl
you may erase the files in the directory wss/config for the default configuration
make -f makeproper to clean the directory
